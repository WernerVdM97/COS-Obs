**Cunning Action:** Arrigal can take a bonus action on each of his turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Evasion:** If Arrigal is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** Arrigal deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Arrigal that isn’t incapacitated and Arrigal doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
