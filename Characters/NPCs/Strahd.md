- Strahd prioritizes targets in the following order: the PCs’ foretold ally; the holder of the Tome of Strahd (if known); wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers; bards, clerics, druids, and artificers; monks, rangers and rogues; fighters, paladins, and barbarians.
- If Strahd ever takes more than 21 damage in a single round, or if Strahd ever takes radiant damage, he immediately retreats to a safe location in order to fully regenerate his hit points.
- Strahd attempts to always maintain a distance of at least 40 feet from any hostile melee combatant who has a Strength (Athletics) modifier of +4 or greater.
- If possible, Strahd never begins or ends his turn within 60 feet of the wielder of the _Sunsword_.
- Strahd always focuses his damage on a single target at a time, and prefers to target wounded enemies over healthy ones.
