### Traits

**Amnesiac.** Exethanter has forgotten his name and all prepared spells, retaining only his cantrips.

**Magic Resistance.** The lich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects (Information from outside the sources).

**Potential Restoration.** A _greater restoration_ spell restores his memory and prepared spells, while a second casting restores his hit point maximum to 135.

---

### Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) cold damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute (Information from outside the sources).

**Cantrips.** In his current state, he can only use cantrips to defend himself.

---

### Reactions

**Arcane Shield.** The lich can use its reaction to cast _shield_ if its memory has been restored (Information from outside the sources).

---

**DM's Roleplaying Note:** Exethanter is not naturally hostile and will ask the party, "Do I know you?" when they enter. If his memory is restored, he becomes a guide who "shares secrets openly," providing passwords to the temple's locked doors and explaining the nature of the dark vestiges. However, he remains "fiercely protective" of his bronze-covered spellbook, _The Incants of Exethanter_, and will attack anyone who attempts to steal it.
Exethanter’s reaction to the party will be defined by his **current state of extreme decrepitude and amnesia**. Unlike many other entities in the Amber Temple, he is not initially hostile; rather, he is a **weak, forgetful husk** of his former self who has even forgotten his own name.

---

### **1. Initial Interaction: Confused Curiosity**

Upon the party's arrival in his lair (Area X27), Exethanter will not attack. Instead, he will simply ask, **"Do I know you?"**. He currently possesses only **99 hit points** and has **forgotten all his prepared spells**, retaining only his cantrips. He assumes that any visitors have come to the temple in pursuit of the same things he once sought: **forbidden knowledge and power**.

### **2. Reaction to Magic: The Potential for Restoration**

Exethanter’s attitude shifts dramatically if the party uses restorative magic on him:

- **Memory Restoration:** If the party casts _**greater restoration**_ on him, his memory and his full list of prepared spells return. He will then remember his name and the passwords to the temple’s various locked doors (except for his phylactery vault in Area X28).
- **Physical Restoration:** A second casting of _**greater restoration**_ restores his health to its maximum of 135 hit points.
- **Consequent Support:** If his health and mind are restored, he becomes a **valuable, albeit detached, ally**. He may offer to **escort the party** through the temple; if he does so, other permanent residents of the temple will not threaten the characters.

### **3. Providing Arcane Guidance**

Exethanter does not believe in hoarding the temple's secrets; he believes in **sharing them openly**.

- **The Sarcophagi:** He will explain the mechanics of the **amber sarcophagi** and the nature of the dark vestiges trapped within them.
- **The Library:** He can provide the **command words** for the magical books found in the Preserved Library (Area X30).
- **Strahd’s History:** He can provide historical context regarding **Strahd’s pact** with the Dark Powers, as he was present when the Count first visited the temple centuries ago.

### **4. Defensive and Possessive Stance**

Despite his general willingness to help, Exethanter remains a **Lich of Evil alignment**.

- **The Spellbook:** He is fiercely protective of his bronze-covered spellbook, _**The Incants of Exethanter**_; he will attack anyone who attempts to take it.
- **Self-Defence:** If the party becomes hostile or attacks him, he will defend himself with his full arcane power (if restored) and will turn to dust only if reduced to 0 hit points.

### **5. Lack of Political Interest**

Crucially for the party's quest, Exethanter has **no interest in challenging Strahd** or participating in the politics of Barovia. He views Strahd merely as a "man of destiny" whose darkness sustains the entities within the temple. He will help the party gain power, but he will not help them use it to overthrow the Count.

**Analogy:** Meeting Exethanter is like **finding an ancient, senile librarian in a library full of cursed books.** At first, he can’t even remember how to use the card catalogue. If you help him find his glasses (his memory), he will happily show you exactly where the most dangerous books are kept and even walk you to the shelf—not because he wants you to succeed, but because he believes information, no matter how lethal, should be free.
