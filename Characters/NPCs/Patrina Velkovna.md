- Cantrips (at will): Fire Bolt, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost, Mage Hand, Minor Illusion
- 1st level (4 slots): Magic Missile, Shield, Mage Armor, Detect Magic
- 2nd level (3 slots): Misty Step, Mirror Image, Hold Person
- 3rd level (3 slots): Counterspell, Fireball, Dispel Magic
- 4th level (3 slots): Greater Invisibility, Ice Storm, Polymorph
- 5th level (2 slots): Cone of Cold, Wall of Force
- 6th level (1 slot): Disintegrate

**Arcane Recovery.** Once per day when Patrina finishes a short rest, she can choose expended spell slots to recover up to a combined level of 5.

**Staff of Power.** The Staff of Power has 20 charges. While holding it, Patrina can expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: *Cone of Cold (5 charges), Fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), Globe of Invulnerability (6 charges), Hold Monster (5 charges), Levitate (2 charges), Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), Magic Missile (1 charge per spell level, up to 7th), Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), Wall of Force (5 charges)*. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If the staff's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties.

**Robe of the Archmagi.** While wearing this robe, Patrina has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Ring of Spell Storing.** The ring currently contains the following spells: *Counterspell (3rd level), Shield (1st level), Feather Fall (1st level)*.

### Reactions

**Counterspell.** When Patrina sees a creature within 60 feet of her casting a spell, she can use her reaction to cast *Counterspell*, automatically negating the spell if it is 3rd level or lower. For spells 4th level or higher, she must make an Intelligence check (DC = 10 + the spellâ€™s level) to negate the spell.

**Shield.** When Patrina is hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell, she can use her reaction to cast *Shield*, increasing her AC by +5 until the start of her next turn.
