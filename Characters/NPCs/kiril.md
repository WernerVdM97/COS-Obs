**_Regeneration._** Kiril regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If he takes necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.

**_Legendary Resistance (1/day)._** If Kiril fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**_Indomitable._** If Kiril would be paralyzed or stunned, he is slowed instead. (His speed is halved, he has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and creatures have advantage on attacks made against him.)

**_Keen Hearing and Smell._** Kiril has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

> [!error] **_Second Phase._** 
> When Kiril is reduced to 0 hit points, he digs his claws into his chest, pulls out his own heart, and devours it. He then doubles in height and breadth, gaining a hunched back, bony protrusions along his arms and shoulders, and a grotesque, bloated head with oversized fangs and teeth, as well as a pair of toothy jaws for eyes. His statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of his second form. His initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage and conditions don’t carry over to his new form.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Kiril makes three melee attacks, up to one of which can be a Bite. He can then immediately use **_alpha's howl_**

**_Claw._** _Melee Weapon Attack_, +10 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**_Bite._** _Melee Weapon Attack_, +10 to hit, range 5 ft., 1 target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies. If the target was already cursed with werewolf lycanthropy and has gained a werewolf's regeneration feature, it can't regenerate until it completes a long rest.

**_Alpha's Howl._** Any number of targets within 60 feet that can hear Kiril and which Kiril or his infected victims have cursed with werewolf lycanthropy must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, losing one level of bloodlust on a success (minimum 0). On a failure, a target gains one level of bloodlust (maximum 2) and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed toward a random creature other than Kiril. If it has at least one level of bloodlust, it must make an attack against the other creature with its claws (see below). If it has two levels of bloodlust, it must also make an attack against the other creature with its bite (see below).

A target with one level of bloodlust gains wolflike claws and can use its claws to make an attack using its Strength modifier (minimum 2), dealing 2d4 slashing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A target with two levels of bloodlust also gains a wolflike muzzle and can use its bite to make an attack using its Strength modifier (minimum 2), dealing 1d8 piercing damage plus its Strength modifier (minimum 2) on a hit. A target with bloodlust is proficient with its claws and bite. A Humanoid bitten in this way must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy until Kiril dies.

### Bonus Actions

**_Savage Frenzy._** Kiril leaps up to his speed without triggering opportunity attacks. Each creature within 5 feet of him must then make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Shapechange._** Kiril polymorphs into his human form or into a dire wolf, or back into his true form (a wolf-humanoid hybrid). His statistics, other than his AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. He reverts to his human form if he dies.

### Reactions

Kiril can take up to three reactions per round, but only one per turn. If Kiril would lose his reactions and isn't incapacitated, he loses one reaction instead.

**_Pounce._** In response to a creature moving within 30 feet, Kiril moves up to his speed toward it without triggering opportunity attacks.

**_Lash Out._** In response to being missed by an attack made by a creature he can see, hear, or smell, Kiril moves up to his speed toward that creature without triggering opportunity attacks. He can then attack that creature with his claws if it's within reach.

**_Maul._** In response to being hit by an attack made by a creature within 5 feet, Kiril attacks that creature with his bite.
