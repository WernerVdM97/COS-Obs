**Traits**

**Hybrid Nature.** Cyrus has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Rampage.** When Cyrus reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on his turn, he can take a bonus action to move up to half his speed and make a bite attack.

**Barbarian Rage (3/day).** As a bonus action, Cyrus can enter a rage for up to 1 minute. He has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll on melee weapon attacks using Strength, and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

**Reckless Attack.** When Cyrus makes his first attack on his turn, he can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives him advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until his next turn.

**Danger Sense.** Cyrus has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that he can see, such as traps and spells.

**Unarmored Defense.** While Cyrus is not wearing armor, his AC equals 10 + his Dexterity modifier + his Constitution modifier (AC 14).

**Relentless Endurance.** When Cyrus is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. He can't use this feature again until he finishes a long rest.

**Chef’s Delight.** Cyrus can prepare a special meal during a long rest. Up to 10 creatures who partake in the meal gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + his Constitution modifier.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Throwing Cleaver.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
