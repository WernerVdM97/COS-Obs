**Fighting Style:** Great Weapon Fighting. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**Second Wind (1/Short Rest):** On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + 5.

**Action Surge (1/Short Rest):** On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.

**Combat Superiority:** Ireena has 4 superiority dice, which are d8s. She regains all expended superiority dice when she finishes a short or long rest. She knows the following maneuvers:

- **Precision Attack:** When you make a weapon attack roll, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.
- **Sweeping Attack:** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.
- **Trip Attack:** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

**Student of War:** You gain proficiency with one type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

**Actions**

- **Multiattack:** Ireena makes two melee attacks.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+4 slashing damage.

**Bonus Actions**

- **Second Wind:** Ireena can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + 5.

**Reactions**

- **Parry:** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + 3.

**Equipment:** Plate armor, greatsword, explorer's pack, and a set of artisan’s tools.
