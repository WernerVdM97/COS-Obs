### Traits

**Cunning Action.** On each of his turns, Piddlewick can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Sneak Attack.** Once per turn, Piddlewick can deal an extra 3d6 damage to a creature he hits with a weapon attack if he has advantage on the attack roll or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.

**Evasion.** When Piddlewick is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage on a successful save, and only half damage on a failed save.

**Halfling Lucky.** When Piddlewick rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, he can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Brave.** Piddlewick has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Piddlewick makes two attacks with his Dagger of Venom.

**Dagger of Venom.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d4 + 6) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) poison damage on a hit (once per day).

**Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

### Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that Piddlewick can see attacks him with an attack that he can see, he can use his reaction to halve the attack's damage against him.

**Deflect Missiles.** When Piddlewick is hit by a ranged weapon attack, he can use his reaction to deflect or catch the missile. If he catches it, he can spend a ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or the damage is reduced by 1d10 + his Dexterity modifier + his monk level.
