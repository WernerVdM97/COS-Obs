**DM Session Notes: Flameskull Guardians**

These creatures are high-priority environmental hazards within the **Amber Temple**.

- **Origin:** The lich Exethanter created these flameskulls from the remains of the temple’s original defenders to serve as permanent guardians.
- **Location 1 (Area X17):** Three flameskulls wreathed in green flame guard the Upper West Hall. They are responsible for incinerating the wizard Jakarion, whose charred corpse remains in the hallway.
- **Tactics (Area X17):** They utilize arrow slits to rain _fireball_ and _magic missile_ spells down upon any intruders they spot on the main temple floor below.
- **Location 2 (Area X33a):** Three additional flameskulls guard this lower vault, floating directly above the amber sarcophagi. They attack intruders on sight and will specifically target anyone attempting to descend the secret shaft from the Southeast Annex.
- **Local Reputation:** Helwa’s mountain folk fear these "fiery spirits" and keep the annex doors closed to avoid drawing their aggression.
- **Movement Restrictions:** These guardians are strictly territorial and will not leave the specific halls or rooms they are assigned to protect.
