**Rage (4/Long Rest):** As a bonus action, Luvash can enter a rage for up to 1 minute. He gains advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, a +2 bonus to the damage on melee weapon attacks using Strength, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. He can’t cast spells or concentrate on them while raging.

**Reckless Attack:** When Luvash makes his first attack on his turn, he can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives him advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until his next turn.

**Danger Sense:** Luvash has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that he can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, he can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

**Feral Instinct:** Luvash has advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if he is surprised at the beginning of combat and isn’t incapacitated, he can act normally on his first turn, but only if he enters his rage before doing anything else on that turn.

**Actions**

- **Multiattack:** Luvash makes two melee attacks.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+4 slashing damage.
- **Handaxe:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6+4 slashing damage.

**Reactions**

- **Uncanny Dodge:** When an attacker that Luvash can see hits him with an attack, he can use his reaction to halve the attack’s damage against him.

**Equipment:** Hide armor, shield, greatsword, 2 handaxes, various Vistani trinkets and charms.

### Lair Actions - Vistani Camp

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Luvash can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Campfire Flare:** The central campfire suddenly flares up, casting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creature within 10 feet of the campfire must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be blinded until the end of its next turn.

2. **Mystic Fog:** A thick, mystical fog fills a 20-foot radius area within the camp. The area becomes heavily obscured for 1 minute. A creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.

3. **Vistani Rally:** Luvash shouts a rallying cry, and all Vistani allies within 60 feet of him that can hear him gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of the next round.

4. **Whispers of the Woods:** The sounds of the forest grow louder and more menacing. Choose one creature that is not deafened. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn.
