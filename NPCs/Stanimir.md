**Bardic Inspiration (d8, 4/Short Rest):** As a bonus action, Stanimir can choose one creature other than himself within 60 feet who can hear him. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d8. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

**Spellcasting:** Stanimir is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following bard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):**
- Mage Hand
- Minor Illusion
- Vicious Mockery

**1st level (4 slots):**
- Charm Person
- Cure Wounds
- Detect Magic
- Faerie Fire

**2nd level (3 slots):**
- Invisibility
- Hold Person
- Lesser Restoration

**3rd level (3 slots):**
- Dispel Magic
- Hypnotic Pattern
- Major Image

**4th level (3 slots):**

- Greater Invisibility

**5th level (2 slots):**
- Animate Objects
- Hold Monster

**Song of Rest:** During a short rest, Stanimir can play soothing music or oration. If he or any friendly creatures who can hear his performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

**Jack of All Trades:** Stanimir can add half his proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check he makes that doesn’t already include his proficiency bonus.

**Actions**

- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8+2 piercing damage.
- **Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6+2 piercing damage.

**Reactions**

- **Cutting Words:** When a creature that Stanimir can see within 60 feet of him makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, he can use his reaction to expend one of his uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. He can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.

**Equipment:** Leather armor, rapier, shortbow, quiver with 20 arrows, lute, various Vistani trinkets, a pouch containing 45 gp.
