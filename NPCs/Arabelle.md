**Arcane Recovery (1/Day):** Once per day when Arabelle finishes a short rest, she can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half her wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

**Spellcasting:** Arabelle is a 5th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Arabelle has the following spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** 
- Fire Bolt
- Prestidigitation
- Mage Hand

**1st level (4 slots):**
- Magic Missile
- Mage Armor
- Shield

**2nd level (3 slots):**
- Misty Step
- Scorching Ray

**3rd level (2 slots):**
- Fireball (uncontrolled)
- Counterspell (uncontrolled)

**Uncontrolled Spells:** Arabelle has two spells that she does not fully control. When she attempts to cast one of these spells, roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or lower, the spell goes out of control, causing unintended effects as described below.

1. **Fireball (Uncontrolled):** On a failed control roll, the Fireball detonates at a random point within 20 feet of the intended target, potentially harming allies or causing unintended damage to the surroundings.
   
2. **Counterspell (Uncontrolled):** On a failed control roll, the Counterspell fails and instead creates a burst of wild magic. Roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (PHB p.104) to determine the effect.

**Actions**

- **Dagger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 piercing damage.

**Reactions**

- **Shield (1st level spell):** Arabelle can cast Shield as a reaction, increasing her AC by +5 until the start of her next turn.

**Equipment:** Simple robes, spellbook, component pouch, dagger, a few personal trinkets, and notes on magical theory.

This statblock presents Arabelle as a young, talented, but inexperienced wizard who is still learning to control her powerful spells. The uncontrolled spells add an element of unpredictability to her character, reflecting her potential and the dangers of her untamed magical abilities.
