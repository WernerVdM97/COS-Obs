**Keen Smell:** The tiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce:** If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

**Steampunk Enhancements:** The tiger has been augmented with steampunk technology, granting it the following abilities:

- **Clockwork Reflexes:** The tiger has advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- **Mechanical Roar (Recharge 5-6):** As an action, the tiger can emit a terrifying, mechanically amplified roar. Each creature within 30 feet of the tiger that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the tigerâ€™s next turn.
- **Steam Vent:** When the tiger is hit with a melee attack, it can use its reaction to release a burst of steam. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn.

**Actions**

- **Multiattack:** The tiger makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10+4 piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+4 slashing damage.

**Reactions**

- **Steam Vent:** When hit by a melee attack, the tiger can release a burst of steam, forcing the attacker to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn.

**Equipment:** Steampunk enhancements, including metal plating and steam-powered mechanisms.
