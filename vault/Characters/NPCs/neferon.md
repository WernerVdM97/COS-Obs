Neferon the arcanaloth is the self-appointed guardian of the [[Amber Temple]], and his reaction to the party will be defined by **lethal aggression masked by layers of magical deception**.

## The "Heinrich Stolt" Deception**

**False Identity:** He often uses _alter self_ and mind blank to appear as an old human wizard named **Heinrich Stolt**.

---

**Analogy:** Neferon is like a **sniper in a clock tower who is also a trained stage actor.** He will happily shoot at you from the safety of the shadows until you break down his door; at that point, he will drop his rifle, put on a costume, and try to convince you that he is actually the tower's harmless old janitor.
