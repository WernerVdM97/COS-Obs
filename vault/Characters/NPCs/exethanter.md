 Meeting Exethanter is like **finding an ancient, senile librarian in a library full of cursed books.** At first, he can’t even remember how to use the card catalogue. If you help him find his glasses (his memory), he will happily show you exactly where the most dangerous books are kept and even walk you to the shelf—not because he wants you to succeed, but because he believes information, no matter how lethal, should be free.
