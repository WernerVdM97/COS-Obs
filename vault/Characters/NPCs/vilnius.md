**Analogy:** Vilnius is like a **starving rat caught in a corner.** He is too terrified of the "cat" outside (the amber golem) to move, but if you offer him a way out, he will grab at it with trembling hands—all while looking for the best moment to bite the fingers that fed him and steal whatever shiny trinkets you might be carrying.
