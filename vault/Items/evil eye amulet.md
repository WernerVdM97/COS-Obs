## Stats

**Cursebreaker Amulet (Wondrous Item)**: Max 3 uses

**Activation**: To remove a curse, the wearer must perform a short ritual that involves invoking the runes on the amulet while holding it close to the afflicted creature. This process takes **1 minute** and can be done during or outside of combat.

## Lore

The Amulet of Curses is said to have been crafted by a circle of clerics dedicated to combating dark magic and curses. It is rumored that the amulet was once owned by a powerful hero who used it to free countless souls from malevolent forces. However, its use has dwindled as more powerful curses emerged, making its power more rare and coveted.

## Requirement

**Saving Throw**: If the curse is particularly potent (such as a curse placed by a powerful being or artifact), the DM may call for a saving throw (DC 15) against the wearer’s spellcasting ability modifier. On a success, the curse is removed. On a failure, the amulet's magic is spent, and the curse remains.
