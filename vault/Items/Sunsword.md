## Lore

The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by
Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original
form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal
blade as strong as steel.
Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to
destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part
of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated,
which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was
busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice
stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's
mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.

The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be
reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however,
gained the properties of a sun blade.
Sentience. 

**Sentience:** The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good
weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a
Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to
a range of 60 feet.

**Personality:** The weapon communicates by transmitting
emotions to the creature carrying or wielding it.
Personality. The Sunsword's special purpose is to
destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the
land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge
for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly
fears its own destruction.
