*The story as it happened*

## Week 1

### [[Village of Barovia]]

Emerging from the woods, the party is confronted by the death house, a cursed residence where they overcome evil and first meet [[Strahd]] on the way out. He welcomes them to the land and [[Flikk]] swears his oath.

The party is hired by [[Ismark]] on a quest to escort his half-sister, [[Ireena]] to safety in [[Vallaki]]. She has been targeted by [[Strahd]] to become his next wife. Ismark believes Vallaki to be the safest place for her. Before leaving they first burry her father and attend the funeral (where they encounter and slay their first vampire. Doru, son of the priest). 

### [[Tsar Camp]]

The party first stops at the Tsar pool to visit the old and wise [[Madam Eva]] for a fated [[B. Fortune Reading]] where they are foretold the prophecy of [[Strahd]]'s downfall at the hand of a group of adventurers who would go around and collect key artifacts to help them in their vendetta. 

The party meets Strahd's first wife, [[Ludmilla]] and right hand, [[Rahadin]], here for the first time. Strahd acknowledges them as his "champions" here for the first time. He also reveals his current agenda, to find and kill [[Rudolph]] Van Richten. Strahd offers his carriage, driven by [[Escher]], for the party's travel.

### [[The Windmill]]

Enroute to the windmill, in Strahd's carriage, the party jumps and kills [[Escher]] in broad daylight.

Arriving at the windmill the party first encounters [[Morgantha]]'s and her two sisters. The sisters are killed, but Morgantha escapes to the ephereal plane.[[Lucian]] is briefly trapped with her, but saved by Strahd's intervention (Strahd uses the opportunity to sow chaos). Upon reappearring from the ephereal plane, [[The Party]] mistakes Lucian for a werewolf demon, and downs him. During this fight [[Elik Moon]] is also infected with lycanthropy. The party learns abouts Lucian curse here for the first time.

Finally, the party also finds Franz (son of [[Lady Fiona Wacther]]) and the scrying mirror.

### [[Vallaki]]

Outside the doors of Vallaki, the party set up camp against the shore of [[Lake Barovia]] and first encounter [[Vasilli Van Holtz]] who appears to just be a silly nobleman.

Upon entering and seeking out the church, the party learns that the sacred bones of Saint Markovia were stolen from the crypt and the hallow spell ruined with it. The party steels it back from the coffin maker, meeting and fighting [[Ana]] for the first time. The party also restores the hallow spell protecting the church and decide against leaving [[Ireena]] here, believing it to not be safe enough. Here they learned of the walled off [[Krezk]] and ultimate safehaven, the [[Abby of Saint Markovia]].

The party does think it a good idea to leave [[Ireena]] with [[Vasilli Van Holtz]] while they explore around.

The party find [[Rudolph]] disguised as Rictavio, at the Inn. [[Lamb]] sneaks above and destroys the offspring of the [[Martikovs]] causing them to flee [[Vallaki]]. The party builds [[The Wagon]] here for the first time, after ditching Strahd's carriage. 
After meeting [[Barron Vargas Valikovic]] the party learns of plans for the festivial of the sun, as well as the coo to resurrect [[Lady Fiona Wacther]] and overthrow the Barron. 

### [[The Carnival]] 

Rictavio leads the party to their first meeting with [[Luvash]] who asks them to find and return his lost daughter, [[Arabelle]]. The party ventures to [[Lake Barovia]] and find her held captive by a fishermen. Here the party is surprised by the lake monster who almost kills them, before the mad wizard intervenes and dissappears into the woods again.

### [[Argonvostholt Manor]] 

The party also stops by the headquarters of the order of the silver dragon, explaining the ghostly revenants they met on theyre journey. Here they meet [[Sir Godfry]] who tasks them with stealing back the skull of Argonvostholt to relight the beacon.

### Back in Vallaki

The party uses the festival of the sun as an opportunity to fake poisoning the baron (who was [[Lamb]] in disguise) capturing him and giving him over to Strahd. Lady Fiona is also killed (by [[Izek]]) in this chaos as well as [[Ana]], but first she kills the [[Monk]] (allowing him to break his oath of silence after death). This leaves Vallaki without any leader and chaos ensues. This is the last time the party would see [[Izek]] and [[Baronnet Victor]] (until Strahd's wedding) who fleas fearing the cultists would kill them.

After the chaos of the festival of the sun, the cultists start burning the barron's house and Vallaki's walls. The party also looses [[Elik Moon]] who has now succumbed to his lycanthropy. They tried locking him up in the jail cells to keep him safe but he shapeshifted under the full moon and escaped, killing all the guards in the process

The party de-escelates the situation instating Vasilli, [[Father Odu]], and the blacksmith [[Lazlo Groza]] as joint leaders and leave to return [[Arabelle]] to the carnival.

## Week 2

### Back at the carnival

The party learns of [[Luvash]]'s evil pact with Strahd and starts a doomed fight amidst many Vistani, here Rudolph and his tiger fight to the death taking Luvash with them, whilst the party flees with Anabelle and a tied up [[Arrigal]]. Rudolph disclosed the location of his stash at the [[Wizard Tower]]'s tower.

### [[Wizard Tower]]

The party find Khazan's wizard tower and for the first time see [[Ez]]'s wagon outside. Here they also find the Tomb of Strahd and learn about [[Sergei]]'s death at the hand of Strahd's pact with Vampyr. They decide to trust Arrigal and leave him here to protect Arabelle.

Outside, they are met by Ludmilla, Rahadin, and some of Strahd's barbarian mountain folk (including a giant) who escort present the dinner invitation and an escort to the castle.

### [[Castle Ravenloft]]

Strahd unveils to the party his plans to recruit them as his battle commanders for when he breaks his lock to Barovia and ventures out into the overworld to overthrow all other corrupted leaders and bring undeniable "peace" and dominance to all. After learning about the death of Rudolph, Strahd's next objective is to wed [[Ireena]]. He tasks the party with safely escorting her to [[Krezk]] and invites them to stay the night.

The party also learned that Strahd has the werewolf leader, [[Emil]], locked in his cells. And that Strahd has killed and feasted on [[Barron Vargas Valikovic]].

The party explores a bit. If not for [[Lamb]], [[Monk]] would have fallen to death but is anyways killed minutes later exploring the crypts where he is revived by an unknown entity and granted magical darkvision. Strahd quests the party to deliver [[Ireena]] to Krezk where the [[Abbot]] shall wed them. 

[[Tuush]] steals the icon of Ravenloft with some slight of hand and runs into [[Ez]] for the first time. Se give him a magical messanger to use and contact her again before drinking an invisibilty poition and leaving.

Lamb, steals [[the deck of many things]] from [[Cyrus]].

The party leaves [[Lucian]] in the hands of [[Ludmilla]] who promises to take care of him and cure his lycanthropy.

### Back past the Windmill

Whilst travelling past the windmill, the party notices a light coming from it and decide to put Morgantha to rest, once and for all. Here they also load the scrying mirror into the wagon for future use.

### [[Krezk]]

Enroute, the party is jumped by a group of werewolves, narrowly escaping...(unknowingly, this would be their first encounter with [[Kiril]]). Arrival in [[Krezk]] is met with a gloomy atmosphere. Rahadin and Ludmilla unloading the brides extravagant jewelry and clothes and preparing her resting place with black roses.

Later that night, the party helps [[Ireena]] flee to an unknown location (which they would later scry and find to be [[The woods]]). The werewolves would save her and bring her back safely in time for the wedding.

### [[Abby of Saint Markovia]]

Searching for help, the party travels to the Church atop Krezk in search for the holy man sent by the morning lord, the [[Abbot]]. They learn of the eventual corruption of the Abbot at the hands of Strahd's and decides to kill his mortal body and offer his soul refuge within the icon of Ravenloft for Tuush to carry with him.

> [!note]  At this point, a twist of fate commences.
> The following has been retconned but will forever be known by Strahd and Lamb:
> 
> Outside Krezk in large tents:
>  - The party attends the bachelours where they gambled their life essence and face [[Kiril]] in a duel to the death.
>  - At the wedding of Strahd, Izek would die in objection to the wedding, Ismark give up on his life, and Lamb free his daughters from by Baba
>  - The party would realise Lucian is now a vampire, see [[Elik Moon]] with a werewolf looking woman, as well as meet [[keshgar]] the druid.
>  - Ez attempts to kill Ireena to prevent Strahd from turning her, knowing of the prophecy. Strahd would emerge from his disguised [[Vasilli Van Holtz]], and stop time to ensure his ability to wed Ireena, but during fate's kiss, would burn to ash together with Ireena by the curse of Vampyr. 
>

However, since Lamb  invoked the twist of fate, the following 
- Ireena survived never to be found by the werewolves and escaped to the winery.
- Lamb would not find his children yet.
- Ismark and Izek live but their whereabouts unknown.
- Kiril survive.
- Not learn of Elik or Lucians fate

## Week 3
### [[Yester hill]] seige of [[The Winery]]

Travelling to [[The Winery]]; the party hopes to find the last bit of goodness in Barovia. The keepers of the feather. Here the martikovs would allow them to join their ranks against evil in return for finding their lost gems.

The first gem is retrieved at [[Yester Hill]] where the party kills [[keshgar]] and prevents the massive wintersplinter golem from seiging the winery.

### Return to the Castle

Before persuing the second gem, the party learns of the magical portal between [[Ana's haversack]] and her crypt in the castle and uses this to sneak in at night. Here they loot more crypts and finally rob the skull of Argonvostholt back. While escaping, [[Volenta]] appears in her giant spider form and narrowly attempts to kill the party before being killed herself.

The haversack is destroyed to prevent the evil from following.

### [[Ruins of Berez]]

Enroute to the Ruins of Berez, the party first stops at Vallaki where Flikk summons Strahd from the deck of many things who downs him and reminds him of his dominance over him. 

### Lighting the Beacon

Next, they pass by the [[Argonvostholt Manor]] again to relight the beacon and accept the family heirloom sword of [[Flikk]], Flame Tongue. 

The second gem is retreived (pryed form the living hut) together with Lamb's children in the [[Ruins of Berez]] after slaying [[Baba Lysaga]]. At this point in time, [[Tuush]] almost TPK'd the party after throwing [[Baba Lysaga]] guilded chest with a glyph of warding at the ground...

### Restoring the farmlands

They party returns the second and last gem to plant in the ground and recucitate the life force of the vineyards. Here they barter with Damian Martikov to buy the Winery and establish a hollow spell over it to protect their dearest allies. They also send aid to the nearby villages in the form of money.

### [[Mount Ghakis]]

After realising those with the power of resurrection have all been slayn, the party now hires [[Kasimir]] to guide them to the [[Amber Temple]] and start their long journey to ascend Mount Ghakis.

### [[Tsolenka Pass]]

The first big step would be crossing the firewall of Tsolenka Pass. The party unintentionally, awakens the outposts' defenses when they try climb over the wall and finally summon the giant monstrosity, the Rocc, who they slay in battle. Flikk narrowly avoids death in this altercation.

The party hikes up the frozen waterfall and takes refuge in a nearby owlbear cave before they head into the temple

## Week 4
### [[Amber Temple]]

*At Castle Raventloft, [[Ludmilla]] asks [[Rahadin]] how long its been since he performed the ritual and suggests they bring Strahd's new plaything, [[Lucian]], along. Ludmidlla shows Lucian how to activate the teleport and the three of them dissappear*

[[The Party]] descends down the neverending stairs at the temple's entrance.
While the party walks for what feels like over an hour, Rahadin swallows a toad on the templer floor while Ludmilla shows Lucian the library.

Once the party reaches the temple floor, there are no vampires to be found. They are warned by the statue not to disturb the evil vestiges locked away in amber.

Ludmilla, leads Rahadin and Lucian to [[Exethanter]] to discuss Lucian's interest in Tenebrous (God of Lichdom). Exethanter leads them to the main vault.

Running away from the amber golems and flame skulls, the party finds [[vilnius]] and keeps him safe with them while looking for his master's staff.
Upon finding it, [[Monk]] snatches it first, locking it to him and obtaining his new flaw.

The party find the first of many circophicgi which isn't in the main vault. [[Monk]] can't resist the dark urge, gains _Vaund the Evasive_'s gift, second flaw.
Lamb finds [[The Lost Shield Guardian]], after poaching [[vilnius]]' amulet.

Lucian accepts the dark gift of Tenebrous and is turned into the first phase of a lich, wiping away his vampirism. He starts preparing his phylactery. 

The party finally finds Ludmilla and Rahadin, fights them + statue + golem
Kills ludmilla, destroys golem, abjures and kills [[Neferon]], uses turn undead and forces Rahadin to run away.

The party continues raiding the Amber temple:
- [[Flikk]] takes _Zantras, the Kingmaker's_ gift. new flaw.
- pockets mitril and the sunsword
- [[Lamb]], _Norganas, the Finger of_ _Oblivion._ new flaw.
- [[Kasimir]] resurrects [[Patrina Velkovna]], [[Tuush]] casts greater restoration
- [[Tuush]], _Savnok the Inscrutible._ empty eye sockets

[[Lucian]], takes both:
Tenebrous, the Corpse Star (gives flaw) and 
_Khirad, the Star of Secrets._ (gives evil trait)

Finally, Lucian takes [[the deck of many things]] and pulls the 'Skull' card summoning Exethanter, [[The Party]] kills Exethanter and his **phylactery**.

## Week 5
### [[The Den of Wolves]]

After hiking back for several days, the party speaks with [[Ez]] who informs them of the developments at the Wolf Den. In a last ditch attempt, [[Kiril]], tries to turn [[Elik Moon]] into a werewolf demon.

On the hills outside the den, the ritual is stopped, [[Elik Moon]] denied the chance to fully turn with [[Ez]] restoring his madness. After being locked away Elik has learned wizardry from notes stolen of survivers/victims in the prison and turned into an Eldricth Knight.

Elik pulls 'The Key' from [[the deck of many things]], earning the [[Sunsword]]. 
[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] handed over by [[Zuleika]], and [[Emil]], after [[Izek]], [[Baronnet Victor]], and [[Ez]] helped free Emil.

### The final dawn

Preparing at the winery, Kasimir and Patrina ask to join the final fight.

The party goes bezerk and draws 6 cards from [[the deck of many things]]

- [[Monk]] draws 'Knight'
- [[Flikk]]: 'Jester', 'Talons' (loosing ALL magical items on his person as they disintegrate), and 'Throne'.
- [[Lamb]]: 'Idiot', and 'Star'

### The fated duel at [[Castle Ravenloft]]

[[The Party]] prepares at the winery, analyzing the Ravenloft map and consulting Patrina’s knowledge of the scrolls recovered from the [[Amber Temple]].

Flick consults [[Ez]] about curing his lycanthropy. With no moonflower remaining, she proposes amputation instead and offers [[Flikk]] a steampunk prosthetic similar to her own.

The party is informed that the Keepers of the Feather are gathering to discuss siege plans at Krezk.  
They meet with Damian [[Martikovs]], [[Baronnet Victor]], [[Izek]], [[Ireena]], and [[Ismark]].

The plan is set:
- The humans will siege the gate.
- The werewolves will scale the walls.
- The ravens will keep watch from the sky.
- The party must sneak inside and confront [[Strahd]] directly.

[[Madam Eva]] bids the party farewell and asks [[Tuush]] to come visit her at her grave when this is all over.

Ireena, now restored to her memories as Tatyana, walks with the party one final time before reuniting with [[Sergei]] at the Blessed Pool by the Shrine of Mother Night.

The party sets out with [[Kasimir]] and [[Patrina Velkovna]]. Patrina suggests that the party keep Strahd occupied while she performs a ritual she drafted the previous night, reverse-engineered from the [[Amber Temple]] scrolls. Unbeknownst to the party, she intends to harness its power for herself.

The party breaches the outer wall to find [[Rahadin]] waiting to escort them to Strahd at the front gate, but he is instantly slain. As they step onto the castle grounds, [[Castle Ravenloft]] begins ascending into the heavens, surrounded by pure darkness.

The party confronts Strahd in his soldier form, wielding his greatsword on the fated balcony of his tower. During the battle, Strahd charms [[Flikk]] into surrendering the [[Sunsword]], then retreats by phasing through the walls and floors, descending deeper into the castle.

In the crypts, Strahd dons [[Strahd's Armour]] and assumes his mage form, wielding his amulet. He mocks the party for their ignorance of Patrina’s true intentions and attempts to convince them to join him one last time and kill her. The party refuses and continues the assault.

After defeating his mage form, Strahd flees to his own crypt. The party navigates the infamous teleporting stair trap one final time. [[Lamb]] realizes he can walk behind the statues and witnesses Strahd draining the Sunsword’s energy into his amulet, transforming into his true vampyr form. [[Ez]] arrives, warning the party about Patrina.

As the final battle reaches its climax—Tuush casting _hold vampire_, a [[Monk]] stunning Strahd, and Flick unleashing a full assault—Kasimir and Patrina arrive, intending to kill Strahd themselves and seal the pact for his power. The monk is caught in the line of fire by Patrina’s _finger of death_, and Strahd retaliates by killing both Patrina and Monk.

*In one last vision from the Gods Monk sees the true fate of his kin killed by werewolves at the command of Strahd. He also sees what is to come, the free'd werewolves resurrect a temple and statue in honour of the monk at the sacred forest that once was his home.*

In a final act, Tuush channels the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]], reigniting the Sunsword and throwing it to Flick. Flick, alongside Lamb, strikes Strahd with everything they have, weakening him enough for Tuush to call upon divine intervention and smite Strahd down with Saint [[Markovia's thighbone]]

The castle erupts as a beam of pure sunlight pierces it from above, and Ravenloft begins to plummet toward the ground. Ez expends all her holy water to burn an emergency exit through the bottom of the castle, casts _feather fall_ on the party, and leaps to safety. As they escape, Lamb finishes Kasimir with a final _finger of death_ charge.

The party watches as Castle Ravenloft incinerates during its descent, crashing into the mountain below.

The mists fade. The clouds part.  
For the first time in 800 years, peace settles over the lands of Barovia.

## [[Epilogue]]
