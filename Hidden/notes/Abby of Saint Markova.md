# Introduction of the Abbot to the Party

**Setting:** The Abbey of Saint Markovia, a desolate and eerie fortress looming over Krezk. The party approaches through the mist-covered path lined with gravestones. The faint sound of discordant bells echoes from the Abbey. As they near the gates, they hear unsettling noises—inhuman cries and laughter mingling with snippets of hymns.

**Description of the Abbot:**  
The Abbot appears as an unnaturally handsome man, his celestial heritage evident in his radiant features and serene demeanor. He wears simple white robes stained with faint crimson streaks, as if from unnoticed wounds. His calm presence is offset by the unsettling air of the Abbey itself, hinting at the dangerous contradictions within him.

# Key Traits to Portray

## Ethereal Calm 

The Abbot speaks in a serene tone, almost unnervingly so, regardless of the situation.

## Divine Authority

He often refers to divine plans, his mission to “heal” Barovia, and his belief in the righteousness of his actions.

## Detached Morality

While kind in manner, his actions and beliefs may come across as alien and unsettling, such as his acceptance of Vasilka as a “perfect bride.”

## On Lycanthropy

He explains that while he can cure it, the price of redemption often requires a “sacrifice” or act of devotion.

>[!hint] will cure Lucian's lycanthropy for tatyana
> harvests moonflowers AKA wolfsbane from the blessed pool

## On Ireena

He becomes deeply intrigued, sensing Tatyana’s soul and referring to Ireena as _“a key to salvation.”_

>[!ERROR] Tatyana's soul must be in a willing vessel. Vasilka is the perfect conduit.
> Will surprise Strahd at his wedding with vasilka instead of Tatyana

## If the Party is Suspicious

The Abbot remains calm but subtly probes their intentions.

- He might say, _“You fear me, yet it is I who have held the darkness at bay here. What drives your mistrust, I wonder?”_
- If pressed, he defends his controversial actions by claiming they are the only way to _“redeem this cursed land.”_

>[!warning] Break the spell to free all barovians. Kill Strahd.

# Hooks

### 1. **The Lost Soul of Saint Markovia**

- **Hook:** The party learns of the tragic history of **Saint Markovia**, the founder of the Abbey, whose soul is believed to be trapped within the Abbey, unable to rest. Locals whisper that Saint Markovia’s spirit occasionally manifests, seeking redemption or a release from her purgatory. This could lead to a quest to uncover the truth behind her entrapment and help her move on.
- **Quest:** Unravel the mystery of Saint Markovia’s death and the curse that binds her spirit. The players may need to find a way to release her from her ethereal prison, possibly requiring them to deal with the Abbey’s other supernatural elements.

### 2. **The Flesh Golem’s Origins**

- **Hook:** Rumors suggest that the **Flesh Golem** in the Abbey is far older and more complex than the one created by the Abbot. Some say it is a creation of dark rituals performed long before the Abbot arrived. The golem’s true origins could reveal secrets about the Abbey’s purpose or even hidden passages within its walls.
- **Quest:** The players could investigate the flesh golem's origins, uncovering a long-buried secret about the Abbey’s past—perhaps an earlier, more horrific iteration of the Abbot’s experiments or a deeper connection to Strahd’s influence.

### 3. **The Forgotten Heir**

- **Hook:** The Abbey is said to be the final resting place of several noble families from Barovia. One of these families is believed to have had a missing heir who vanished years ago. The party is approached by an NPC with a personal connection to this family and asks for their help in finding the heir’s body or legacy within the Abbey.
- **Quest:** The players must find the long-lost heir or the remnants of their family in the Abbey. This could reveal hidden wealth, a dangerous family secret, or even the heir’s own cursed destiny tied to Strahd’s rule.

### 4. **The Abbot’s Research**

- **Hook:** The Abbot’s strange experiments with the undead, particularly the flesh golems, are not the only dark research being conducted in the Abbey. The players could discover that the Abbey is home to old tomes and forgotten knowledge about **lycanthropy**, **vampirism**, or even ways to control the dead. The Abbot’s research may have dangerous consequences if misused.
- **Quest:** Players could stumble upon hidden texts or forbidden knowledge that might aid them against Strahd or the Abbot. They could choose to destroy the research or take it to use for themselves, risking the wrath of the Abbot.

### 5. **The Choir of the Dead**

- **Hook:** The Abbey is said to house a **choir of the dead**, spirits of those who have passed away in Barovia but are still bound to the Abbey. Occasionally, the sounds of their haunting, mournful songs can be heard echoing through the halls. It’s said that those who listen too long are drawn into a trance or madness.
- **Quest:** The players could investigate these ethereal voices and discover they are more than just spirits—they are a form of undead guardians created by the Abbot, or possibly, remnants of the spirits of former monks or worshippers. Dealing with the choir may involve confronting these spirits or discovering a way to quiet the cursed music.

### 6. **The Curse of the Abbot’s Sacrifices**

- **Hook:** Rumors suggest that the Abbot has been making **sacrifices** to Saint Markovia in exchange for divine power and favor. These sacrifices may be humans or other innocent beings brought to the Abbey. Some say the Abbot’s power is tied to these dark pacts, and his obsession with creating life from death could have greater consequences.
- **Quest:** The party could investigate the Abbot’s use of sacrifice and uncover a dark conspiracy. It might involve freeing victims who are imprisoned or even stopping the Abbot from completing a final ritual that could unleash horrors upon Barovia.
