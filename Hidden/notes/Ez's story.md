## my mentor

"It was nearly two decades ago that I first saw him. My family was travelling with the Radanavich clan—a Vistani caravan—when a Radanavich child fell deathly ill. The child’s parents took him to a local doctor—a man by the name of Rudolph van Richten.

"Van Richten did all he could to keep the boy alive. Three days later, however, he passed away—and his father, a leader among the Radanaviches, blamed Van Richten for his child's death. That night, aided by four others, he stole into Van Richten's family home and kidnapped Van Richten's own son in vengeance.  My parents awoke me at midnight, and we departed at once. It was only later that I learned what cargo we were carrying—and that my own parents had helped acquire him.

"Van Richten himself, desperate to rescue him, tracked our caravan down and bound my parents to a tree. After extracting his son's location, however, he departed without shedding a drop of their blood—an act of mercy I have never forgotten.

"Ten years later, I ran from home, seeking to follow in Van Richten's footsteps. I found him a man changed—scarred and haunted by the years that had passed. His kindness, however, had never faded, and he agreed to take me on as his student. I spent two years with him, learning all I could about monsters and how to fight them, before we ultimately parted ways."

## the beast

"It was a year after I'd parted ways with Dr. Van Richten, and I felt as though no monster could challenge me. That's when I heard whispers of a beast known as the Black Terror—a werewolf that was the bane of several villages skirting the dark forests of Darkon. I vowed to track it and put an end to its reign of terror.

"It took many nights of investigation and research, but I finally caught sight of the beast at the edge of a shadowed swamp, its fangs stained red with the blood of its latest meal. My heart raced as I watched it slip into the mists—no ordinary fog, but the veil that shrouds the worlds themselves—and I knew that if I failed to pursue it, I might be forced to begin my hunt anew.

In my arrogance, I thought I could handle whatever lay beyond. I was a Vistani—a born wanderer of the Mists—and a student of Rudolph van Richten himself. I plunged ahead without a second thought—and the Black Terror ambushed me, springing from the gloom with claws and teeth. He tore off my leg below the knee, my bright blood staining his charcoal hide.

In that moment, I knew I would die, alone and powerless—until Dmitri and Anna emerged from the woods, cold silver flashing in their hands. The werewolf fled, and the Krezkovs brought me back to their home, where they nursed me back to health. When I recovered, they took me to Vallaki and commissioned the local toymaker, a brilliant man called Blinsky, to craft me a new leg. To this day, this leg reminds me of the importance of caution—and the dangers of unchecked zeal.
