The primary residents and visitors include:

- [[Lucian]], [[Ludmilla]], and [[Rahadin]] (wearing [[Strahd's Armour]]), performing a ritual to Strahd
- **[[exethanter]] the Lich:** An ancient archmage who discovered the secret of lichdom within the temple. He currently resides in area X27, though he has become **weak and forgetful**, failing to remember his name or his spells unless restored by a _greater restoration_ spell.
- **[[neferon]] the Arcanaloth:** This creature guards the Temple of Lost Secrets from within the **hollow head of a forty-foot-tall faceless statue**. He often uses _alter self_ to appear as an old human wizard named Heinrich Stolt.
- **[[vilnius]] and his Quasit:** A cowardly and greedy human **mage** who is currently hiding behind a lectern in the lecture hall (area X9). He is the apprentice of the now-dead wizard Jakarion and is accompanied by an **invisible quasit familiar**.

- **Magical and Undead Guardians:** The temple is heavily fortified with **[[flameskulls]]** created from the remains of the temple's previous defenders.
