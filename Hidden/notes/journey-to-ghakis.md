## **PHASE 1 — PREPARATION AT THE WINELANDS**

### **Arrival Mood**

* Martikovs greet them with **nervous gratitude**.
* The return of two gems shifts the winery from dying to **barely alive**.
* A cold wind from Mount Ghakis signals a storm front—**48 hours** before it hits.

---

## **Core Challenges (Pick 2–3)**

### **1. Supply Check (Survival + Social)**

Kasimir demands:

* cold-weather gear
* climbing gear
* enough food for 3 days

**Fail:** They’re short on something → disadvantage later vs. exhaustion unless they improvise.
**Choice:** Martikovs can give what they have, but this weakens the winery’s defenses for days.
Ask the party: *“Do you take everything they offer or leave them better supplied?”*

### Supply Check — Expanded Challenge

### What They *Need*

Kasimir insists on:

* cold-weather cloaks
* crampons / spikes
* 100 ft rope + pitons
* 3 days rations
* torches or magical light
* healer’s kit

### What the Winery *Has*

* 3 good cloaks, 2 patched
* climbing gear for 3
* rations: enough for party *or* winery, not both
* torches plenty, oil low
* 1 healer’s kit

### Skill Interaction

* **Survival (14):** know what’s essential
* **Persuasion (13):** get more from Martikovs
* **Insight (12):** see how strained they are
* **Investigation (12):** find hidden surplus
* **Nature (14):** gauge the storm
  Kasimir gives advantage on Survival.

### Outcomes

**Well-prepared:** full kit, winery stable → advantage on first exhaustion check.
**Over-supplied:** party takes everything → 1 free Survival reroll later.
**Under-prepared:** missing gear → first failed Survival check = exhaustion.
**Creative fix:** improvised gear → temporary bonus until the pass.

### DM Prompts

* “Kasimir eyes the single healer’s kit. *Who carries it?*”
* “Davian: *If we give you these rations, we go hungry. Are you certain?*”
* “Climbing gear fits three. How do you handle that?”



---

### **2. Morale Fracture Moment**

Strahd’s presence presses in.
A murder of ravens suddenly scatters. A soft whisper brushes the rogue’s ear:
**“Your children are cold.”**

**Check:** Wisdom save.

* **Fail:** 1 level of fear-based exhaustion until camp.
* **Win:** They glimpse Strahd’s watching silhouette cresting a distant hill.

Ask: *“Do you confront the vision, or keep it to yourself?”*

---

### **3. Kasimir’s Warning**

Kasimir quietly pulls aside the monk:

> “Your soul feels… tethered. Don’t trust every voice in the Temple.”

If the monk pushes for details, he refuses until camp on the mountain.
Ask you: *Should Kasimir hint at sensing Vampyr, or keep it vague?*

---

### **4. Winery Tension Event**

Petya (one of the younger Martikovs) reveals a cryptic note found by the vats:
**“The blood above calls for a price.”**
No one claims to have written it.

Ask the party: *“Do you investigate or ignore it?”*
Investigation leads nowhere—just atmosphere.

---

### **5. Final Blessing**

The cleric can hold a short ritual to bless the journey.
**Success:** 1 free reroll on a survival check during the ascent.
**Fail:** A raven falls dead mid-ritual—a bad omen.

---

## **Phase 1 End Trigger**

Storm clouds gather over Mount Ghakis.
Kasimir saddles up.
The winery watches in silence as they depart.

---

### PHASE 2 — Journey to Tsolenka Pass

Harsh, real, and time-pressured. Kasimir keeps the group on track but can’t shield them from the mountain’s cruelty.

---

### Core Structure (3–4 beats)

1. **The Ascent Begins — Terrain Skill Challenge**
2. **Weather Shift — Cold, Wind, and Time Pressure**
3. **Predator or Spirit Encounter**
4. **Night Camp Before the Pass**

---

### 1. Terrain Skill Challenge

A half-day of steep, icy paths.
Each player contributes once.

**Checks (DC 14–15):** Survival, Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception, or tool use.
Kasimir’s guidance = advantage on the *first* failed check the party makes.

**Success:** No exhaustion, reach mid-trail early.
**Fail 1–2:** One party member gains level 1 exhaustion.
**Fail 3+:** Party is slowed → must camp early, storm overtakes them sooner.

DM prompt: *“The ledge narrows to boot-width. Who leads, who anchors the rope?”*

---

### 2. Weather Shift — The Wind Wall

A sudden blast of freezing air. Snow begins drifting sideways.

**Group Con Save (DC 13):**

* Success: No effect.
* Fail: Cold bites → 1 level of exhaustion unless properly cloaked.
* Critical fail: Someone drops gear (roll to see who and what).

Optional twist: A distant church bell rings once from the mountainside—auditory hallucination or omen.

DM prompt: *“The wind howls like a scream. Do you push through or seek shelter?”*

---

### 3. Predator or Spirit Encounter (Choose One)

**A. Mountain Dire Wolf Pack**
Hungry, driven from higher up by storm.

* 2–3 wolves, hit-and-run tactics.
* Goal: isolate the weakest/most wounded.

**B. The Wind-Wraith**
An emaciated Barovian ghost frozen into the mountainside.

* It whispers a warning: “The Temple answers all… but never kindly.”
* Interaction can grant **advantage on the next Insight** or inflict **fear** if ignored.

**C. Strahd’s Shadow**
A silhouette on horseback above the ridge, watching.

* No combat.
* Rogue gets a whisper: “Two little hearts still beat.”

DM prompt: *“You see shapes in the blowing snow—do you stand your ground or avoid them?”*

---

### 4. Camp Before the Pass

Weather gets worse; they must camp or risk night-climbing.

**Challenges:**

* **Setting camp (Survival 14):** Fail = cold seeps in, 1 random PC makes a Con save or takes exhaustion.
* **Fire (Arcana/Nature 13):** Magical fire burns low due to wind.
* **Watch order:** On the second watch, a distant scream across the mountains. Kasimir claims it’s just wind. He’s lying.

Optional hook:
The monk hears a faint heartbeat from deep below the glacier (Vampyr influence).

#### Owlbear demon

DM prompt: *“The storm’s first flakes hit your tents. Who takes first watch?”*

---

### PHASE 3 — Tsolenka Pass

Mostly vanilla, but tightened with tone, choices, and tension.

---

### 1. Approaching the Gates

Wind funnels through the canyon. The bridge ahead groans.

**Perception (13):** notice old blood frozen on the stone.
**Arcana/Religion (13):** sense the lingering magic of the guardian statues.

DM prompt: *“Do you cross in a line or stagger your approach?”*

---

### 2. Guardian Statues

Use the book’s effects, but add one choice:

**If someone steps too close:**

* cold breath triggers
* a whisper rides the wind: *“Turn back.”*

**Optional tweak:**
Kasimir refuses to go first. He knows these statues.

DM prompt: *“Kasimir hangs back. Who tests the path?”*

---

### 3. Bridge Crossing

Gale-force winds, icy footing.

**Group Check (Athletics/Acrobatics 14):**

* Success: clean crossing.
* Fail: one player slips → immediate Dex save or drop gear / take damage.
* Major fail: someone goes over the edge unless roped.

If roped, the strain forces **another Con save (13)** or exhaustion from the cold drag.

DM prompt: *“Halfway across, the wind spikes. Do you rush or brace?”*

---

### 4. The Roc’s Shadow (Optional)

Not an attack—just a pass overhead.
A massive shape blots out the sun for a moment.

**Wisdom save (12):**

* Fail: fear until crossing ends.
* Success: gain advantage on next Perception (heightened senses).

---

### 5. The Amber Doors View

At the end of the pass, the trail bends. They glimpse the distant temple walls for the first time—tiny, far below the summit.

Strahd’s carriage tracks are visible on the far side but half-buried.

DM prompt: *“Kasimir exhales. ‘We’re close.’ Do you push on immediately or rest?”*

---

### PHASE 4 — Finding the Temple Near the Summit

Harsh, disorienting, and meant to wear them down before the final approach.

---

### 1. Whiteout Maze

A sudden whiteout blinds the trail. Visibility drops to a few steps.

**Group Survival (15)** with Kasimir giving advantage once.

* Success: stay on the path.
* Fail: drift onto unstable snowfield → soft avalanche (Dex save 14 or take damage / drop gear).

DM prompt: *“The world turns white. Who takes the lead rope?”*

---

### 2. The Frozen Choir

Faint voices echo from cracks in the cliff—monk hears them louder.

**Religion/Arcana (14):** realize these are trapped spirits bound to the mountain.
**Listen anyway:** take psychic damage + monk gains a brief vision of amber light pulsing under the ice.

DM prompt: *“The whispers get louder if you linger. Move on or investigate?”*

---

### 3. The Vertical Scramble

A final climb up jagged frozen rocks.

**Athletics/Acrobatics (14):**

* Success: clean ascent.
* Fail: slip → rope strain → Con save or exhaustion.
  **If missing climbing gear:** auto Disadvantage.

DM prompt: *“Kasimir points upward. ‘No other route.’ How do you arrange the climb?”*

---

### 4. The False Plateau

A flat ledge that seems safe but shifts with hollow resonance.

**Investigation/Perception (13):** notice thin ice layer over a crevasse.
Breaking through triggers a **Dex save (15)** to avoid falling in.
Inside: bones of a large humanoid frozen mid-crawl.

Optional clue: scratch marks forming the word “GREED.”

DM prompt: *“Cracks spider underfoot. Do you move fast or probe ahead?”*

---

### 5. First Glimpse of the Temple

The storm parts for a moment.
Amber structures jut from the cliff like broken teeth.
A faint orange glow pulses from below the snowpack.

**Insight (13):** Kasimir tenses—hope and fear mixed.

DM prompt: *“The air vibrates with ancient power. Do you push straight to the entrance or scout?”*
