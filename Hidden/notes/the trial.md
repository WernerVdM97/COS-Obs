# **Initiating Combat: Ambush**

- **Stealth Check (DC 14)**: Wolves try to ambush the party from the surrounding woods.
    - On a success: Wolves attack with **Surprise**, gaining a free round.
    - On a failure: Combat begins normally.

## **Environmental Features:**

- **Fog:** Thick mist provides **lightly obscured terrain**, giving creatures half cover.
- **Dense Trees:** Moving through the woods is difficult terrain unless the character succeeds on a DC 13 Acrobatics check.
- **Howling Pack (Optional Timer):** Roll 1d4 at the start of every round—on a 1, **another wolf joins** at the end of the round.

---

## **Phase 1: The Scouts' Attack**

- **6 Wolves** engage the party in the first wave. These are weaker, but aggressive.

**Wolf Mechanics:**

- **Pack Tactics:** Wolves gain advantage on attack rolls when an ally is within 5 feet of the target.
- **Blood Frenzy:** When a wolf lands a critical hit, it can make one extra bite attack as part of the same action.

### **Player Challenges:**

- Players can **perceive something off** about the wolves (Insight DC 13) to realize they are acting under a ritual.
- Killing all the wolves **without mercy** may have narrative consequences—some were just children undergoing the trial.

## **Phase 2: Werewolves Unleashed**

As the last wolf dies or flees, **2 Werewolves** emerge from the woods. They are in **human form**, smiling cruelly, and say, “The pups didn’t make it. Now it’s your turn.” They transform into their hybrid forms mid-battle.

**Werewolf Mechanics:**

- **Shapechanger:** Werewolves can switch between hybrid and wolf forms as a bonus action.
- **Hunter’s Mark:** The werewolves mark a character they view as prey, gaining an extra 1d6 damage on hit.
- **Ritual Sacrifice (Environmental Hazard):** As part of the trial, **fallen characters** may attract the attention of more wolves. If a character drops to **0 HP**, roll 1d4:
    - On 1-2, 2 additional wolves arrive at the end of the round.
    - On 3-4, no reinforcements arrive.

### **Player Challenges:**

- **Silver Weapons or Magic Required:** Werewolves are resistant to non-silvered or non-magical attacks.
- **Curse of Lycanthropy:** If a werewolf deals a bite that reduces a character’s HP to 0, the character must make a DC 12 Constitution save or become infected.
