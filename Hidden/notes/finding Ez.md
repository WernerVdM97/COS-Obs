    - Signs of a **violent fight**: shattered glass, burn marks, and a trail of Ez's **blood droplets** leading outside.
    - A **silver knife** is lodged in the floor, implying Ez fought off a wolf-like foe (hinting at werewolves).
    - **Burned wolf fur** suggests Ez fought and injured a werewolf.
    
    **Arcana/Medicine DC 13**

3. **A Hastily Written Note (Clue 1)**  
    Found tucked beneath the knife, half-burned, and written in Ez’s handwriting:  
    _“She’s with the wolves. I’ll meet you at…”_ (The rest is burned, but the handwriting matches Ez's.)
    - This implies that **Ez was tracking Anabelle** and may have gone toward the werewolves’ lair.

4. **Blood Trail Outside (Clue 2)**
    
    - **A faint trail of blood** leads toward the western woods.
    - The blood is fresh but thins out after about 50 feet, suggesting someone escaped with little time to rest.
    
    **Survival/Investigation DC 15**
