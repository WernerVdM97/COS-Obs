## the trip
past vallaki
vasilli, father odu, and the blacksmith bow
townsfolk quiet and scared

past the windmill
morgantha waves?

## arrival

> [!quote] Main gate
> After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.

 - Wolves and Ravens along the path
 
> [!quote] Chasm
> An imposing drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams looms high above the chasm, suspended by chains of thick, rust-eaten iron that creak and strain under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously.

 - Rahadin welcomes party after lowering draw bridge

 > [!quote] Drawbridge
 > The carriage lurches forward, its wheels creaking as it rolls onto the drawbridge. The wooden planks groan beneath its weight, each hoofbeat striking a somber drumbeat against the ancient structure. You catch a final glimpse of the gargoyles atop the walls, their stony grins resembling leers amidst the shadows of the keep.

 > _after crossing_
 > 
 > A low rumbling cuts through the rain. In the distance, you see the massive chains of the drawbridge tense, their links clanking against one another as the mechanism awakens once more. Slowly, like a stirring giant, the drawbridge rises into the night, leaving the fog-choked chasm behind. With a shuddering thud, it settles into place, the torchlight flickering across its wooden beams and rusted iron bolts once more.

 
## welcoming
> [!quote] Foyer and Hallway
> You pass through the ornate outer doors into the castle's vaulted entry foyer, your footsteps echoing on the dark stone floor. Overhead, four statues of dragons glare down, their lifelike eyes flickering in the torchlight.
> 
> Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors, manned by two figures. 
> _Mongrefolk, Baba Lysaga and Gertruda_

- dragon wormling statues
- in the foyer, with stealable statue?
- gifts given to the party?

	- dagger
	- sword
	- flute
	- rings
	- spellbooks

> [!quote] server
> A thin man dressed in fine servant’s clothes exits the torchlit staircase, his face completely obscured by a pale white mask. He holds a tray with several wine glasses and two pitchers of liquid upon it—one deep purple, one bright crimson—and steps carefully across the stone floor toward you.
> 
> _tongue and fingers cut off_

Anton is serving his sister's blood.

> [!quote] the cluts 
> The masked man stumbles, losing his grip on the red pitcher—and a wave of crimson liquid soars through the air before splashing across Volenta’s golden gown. The other vampires abruptly fall silent as Volenta whirls toward him, her sodden dress hanging limply across her chest. Her eyes burn with frenzied rage behind her mask, and her hand tightens around her wine glass so hard it shatters.

Volenta attempts to kill him, excuses herself thereafter. Rahadin too de-escelate if needed.

> [!quote] Strahd's introduction 
>The sound of light applause fills your ears.
> 
> Volenta’s nostrils flare, her eyes glittering with rage. Her hand shifts, the broken glass blurring toward the man’s exposed neck—
> A man’s stern voice, rich and resonant, cuts through the air. 
> 
> “You forget yourself," he intones, “There are guests in our home."
> 
> Volenta’s hand freezes, a hair’s breadth from slicing through flesh.
> 
> Even, measured footsteps echo from the grand stone staircase, and a tall, elegant figure descends into view. He wears a fitted vest of rich scarlet above a crisp white shirt, each ornate fastening meticulously buttoned.
> 
> He moves with a cat’s grace, his long, velvet-black cloak whispering through the air behind him. As he approaches, the flickering light of the torches dances across his pale skin, his crimson eyes glinting like rubies.
> 
> "Good evening," Strahd von Zarovich says, his lips curling into a cordial smile.

> [!quote] Imagine that you are the liege and master of a vassal lord. When you descend to collect this year’s taxes from your vassal’s village, your accountant reports that the year’s taxes are woefully short. When asked to explain, the lord explains that the harvests have been lean and sickness has plagued the village. You notice, however, that the lord wears a fine gold chain around his neck and a new wool cloak with buttons crafted of pure silver. What do you do?
		
> [!quote]  Imagine that you are the monarch of a realm. One day, a fearsome archmage raises an army of the undead in rebellion against you. As he approaches your keep, you have an opportunity to parlay with him upon the drawbridge of your castle. What do you do?
		
> [!quote] Imagine again that you are the monarch of a realm. As you sleep in your bed, an assassin slips into your chambers, but is frightened away by your guards’ timely arrival before your throat can be slit. What do you do?

### after party 
strahd has his bridal dance with Ireena, party escorted to the exit
> [!quote] _Before departing the Great Entry, Strahd encourages one or more of the players to take a torch from a sconce in the Guests’ Hall to light their way._ “My eyes are well-adjusted to the shadows that lurk in these halls," he says wryly, “but a mobile source of light might be kinder to your own senses."

On the way back, hooded barron and Rahadin

> [!quote ] The figure is a man, his eyes wide and terrified. His body, however, has been warped beyond recognition—his muscles grotesquely swollen, his skin cracked and fissured like parched earth. Most unsettling of all are the four lumps that adorn his shoulders, each resembling a tiny, misshapen head with its eyes squeezed shut.
> 
> already sentenced, asks the player to decide his death.

Before crossing
> [!quote] A flash of blinding white fills the air above the courtyard, and an explosion of sound rattles the broken glass and iron latticework of the chamber’s large window. As the acrid scent of ozone fills the room, you see a cloud of thick, black smoke rising from one of the towers beside the raised drawbridge.
> 
> Strahd then invites them to stay, and has Ludmilla (and then piddlewick) escort them back.

### nightmare
> [!quote] After falling asleep
> Something heavy thumps against the closet door. Moments later, the clock on the wall strikes ten. With each sonorous chime, the miniature castle’s front gates swing open, unveiling an intricate ironwrought bat whose tiny wings repeatedly unfurl and collapse.
> 
> As the final chime fades, each of you feels two cold, sharp pressures prick against the flesh of your necks, which quickly give way to a strange, tingling numbness.

Each time the clock chimes, each player must immediately make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on a failure or half as much on a success

The player is given perpetual spiral stairs to and from the guest suite room, each time portraying their crime in the etheral plane, limited interaction taking place.
