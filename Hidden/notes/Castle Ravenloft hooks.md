> [!quote] Imagine that you are the liege and master of a vassal lord. When you descend to collect this year’s taxes from your vassal’s village, your accountant reports that the year’s taxes are woefully short. When asked to explain, the lord explains that the harvests have been lean and sickness has plagued the village. You notice, however, that the lord wears a fine gold chain around his neck and a new wool cloak with buttons crafted of pure silver. What do you do?

> [!quote] After falling asleep
> Something heavy thumps against the closet door. Moments later, the clock on the wall strikes ten. With each sonorous chime, the miniature castle’s front gates swing open, unveiling an intricate ironwrought bat whose tiny wings repeatedly unfurl and collapse.
> 
> As the final chime fades, each of you feels two cold, sharp pressures prick against the flesh of your necks, which quickly give way to a strange, tingling numbness.
