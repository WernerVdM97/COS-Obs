# The story so far
Arrival in [[Village of Barovia]]: the party is hired by [[Ismark]] on a quest to escort his half-sister, [[Ireena]] to safety in [[Vallaki]]. She has been targeted by [[Strahd]] to become his next wife.

Pit stop at [[The Windmill]]; slay [[Morgantha]]'s sisters and find the scrying mirror. Fighting a werewolf demon, [[Elik Moon]] is infected with lycanthropy.

A night to remember in [[Vallaki]]; after meeting [[Lady Fiona Wacther]] and [[Barron Vargas Valikovic]] the party decides not to interfere with politics, but uses the festival of the sun as an opportunity to slay [[Ana]]. In the process they loose [[Elik Moon]] who has now succumbed to his lycanthropy. The party also restores the hallow spell protecting the church and decide against leaving [[Ireena]] here.

A detour to [[The Carnival]] leads the party to their first altercation with [[Luvash]] and causes the death of [[Rudolph]] where they learn convince [[Arrigal]] to lead them to [[Arabelle]] at [[Lake Barovia]]

At [[Lake Barovia]]; the party find Khazan's wizard tower and for the first time see [[Ez]]'s wagon outside. Here they also find the Tomb of Strahd and learn about [[Sergei]] death at the hand of Strahd's pact with Vampyr

The party return to Vallaki and adventures to [[Argonvostholt Manor]] to accept the quest from [[Sir Godfry]] to relight the beacon.

After invitation to dine at [[Castle Ravenloft]]; the party explores a bit. If not for [[Lamb]], [[Monk]] would have fallen to death but is anyways killed minutes later exploring the crypts where he is revived by an unknown entity and granted magical darkvision. Strahd quests the party to deliver [[Ireena]] to Krezk where the [[Abbot]] shall wed them. The party leaves [[Lucian]] in the hands of [[Ludmilla]] who promises to take care of him and cure his lycanthropy.

Arrival in [[Krezk]] is met with a gloomy atmosphere. The party notices the corruption of the [[Abbot]] and opts to put an end to his misery. Thereafter they help [[Ireena]] flee into the woods. 

At this point, a twist of fate commences.

The following has been retconned but will forever be known by Strahd and Lamb:

The party attends the wedding of Strahd, where Izek and Ismark would die, Lamb free his daughters from by Baba. Realise Lucian is now a vampire. Meet [[keshgar]] and slay [[kiril]]. Ez attempts to kill Ireena to prevent Strahd from turning her, knowing of the prophecy. Strahd would stop time to ensure his ability to wed Ireena, but during fate's kiss, would burn to ash together with Ireena by the curse of Vampyr. 

However, since Lamb pulled the deck of many things and invoked the twist of fate the following happened instead:

Ireena survived never to be wedded and escaped to the winery.
Lamb would not find his children yet
Ismark and Izek live.
Kiril survive.

Travelling to [[The Winery]]; the party hopes to find the last bit of goodness in Barovia. The keepers of the feather. Here the martikovs would allow them to join their ranks against evil in return for finding their lost gems.

The first gem is retrieved at [[Yester Hill]] where the party kills [[keshgar]] and prevents the massive wintersplinter golem from seiging the winery
The second gem is retreived together with Lamb's children in the [[Ruins of Berez]] after slaying [[Baba]]

After realising those with the power of resurrection have all been slayn, the party now hires [[Kasimir]] to guide them to the [[Amber Temple]].
