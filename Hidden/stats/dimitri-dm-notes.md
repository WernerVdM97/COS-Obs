## Sister, Zuleika

## Ritual

Every two weeks, on the night of the full moon, Baroness Krezkova harvests a wolfsbane flower from the shores of Krezk’s blessed pool and brews a _potion of wolfsbane_, which she gives to Baron Krezkov to suppress the curse’s aggression. She then locks the Baron in silver shackles in the hidden basement beneath their cottage, where he transforms into a docile wolf at moonrise. Until recently, both Ilya and Kala were ignorant as to their family’s true nature, which their parents have kept a careful secret from both the village and their children.
