### Traits

**Shapechanger.** As an action, Strahd can transform into a bat or mist (as per the Vampire statblock). In these forms, he cannot attack but remains elusive.

**Elusive Duelist (Recharge 5–6).** When Strahd is hit with an attack, he can immediately move up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Regeneration.** Strahd regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If he takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of his next turn.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Vampiric Weaknesses.** Strahd takes 20 radiant damage if he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

**Unarmored Duelist.** Strahd gains a +2 bonus to AC while wearing no armor.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Strahd makes two melee attacks.

**Sword of Shadows.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. On a critical hit, the target also takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Strahd teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is in dim light or darkness.

**Grasp of Shadows (Recharge 5–6).** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be restrained by shadowy tendrils until the end of Strahd's next turn.
