![[volenta's dagger]]
## Lore

## Requirement

## Curse:  Pactbound

Upon attunement, you become **a servant of the pact**, indirectly connected to Strahd’s will.

- **Oath of Night.** You **cannot attune to radiant-aligned weapons or holy symbols**. Healing magic from good-aligned clerics and paladins heals you for only half.
    
- **Mark of the Pact.** Once per long rest, Strahd can speak to you in dreams or through reflections. He may demand information, give false visions, or compel you to protect his interests (Charisma save DC 16 to resist).
    
- **Mother Night’s Favor.** If you ever willingly attack Strahd or attempt to destroy the dagger, roll on the **Short-Term Madness table** (DMG pg. 259).
