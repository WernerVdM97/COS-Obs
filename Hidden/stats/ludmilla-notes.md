Here’s a **tight MM-style statblock** for **Ludmilla Vilisevic**, tuned as a **CR 9–10 spellcasting lieutenant** for Strahd. Clean, lethal, not bloated.

### Traits

**Vampire Weaknesses.** Ludmilla has the standard vampire weaknesses (sunlight hypersensitivity, running water, stake to the heart).

**Regeneration.** Ludmilla regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water.

**Blood of Strahd.** While Strahd is on the same plane, Ludmilla has advantage on concentration checks.

**Spellcasting.** Ludmilla is an 8th-level spellcaster (Intelligence; spell save **DC 16**, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She requires no material components.

---

### Spell List

**At will:** _chill touch, mage hand, minor illusion_  
**1st level (4 slots):** _shield, absorb elements, charm person_  
**2nd level (3 slots):** _misty step, darkness, mirror image_  
**3rd level (3 slots):** _counterspell, fireball, vampiric touch_  
**4th level (2 slots):** _blight, blight_ or _blight, blight_ (Barovia classic), _blight_  
_(Swap blight for blight-adjacent spells freely)_

---

### Actions

**Dagger.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.  
Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

**Blood Hex (Recharge 5–6).** One creature Ludmilla can see within 60 ft must succeed on a **DC 16 Con save** or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and Ludmilla regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

---

### Reactions

**Spell Ward.** When hit by an attack, Ludmilla can cast _shield_ or _absorb elements_ without expending a spell slot (once per round).

---

### Tactics (1 line, DM-facing)

Opens with control (_darkness / fireball_), counters key spells, feeds with _vampiric touch_, retreats via _misty step_.

If you want, I can:

- Make her **Amber Temple–ritual focused**
    
- Downgrade to **CR 8** or spike her to **CR 10**
    
- Add a **Blood Bond** mechanic with Strahd or Rahadin
