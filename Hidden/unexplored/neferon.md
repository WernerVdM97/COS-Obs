Neferon the arcanaloth is the self-appointed guardian of the Temple of Lost Secrets, and his reaction to the party will be defined by **lethal aggression masked by layers of magical deception**.

According to the sources, the party can expect the following interactions with Neferon:

### **1. Immediate and Long-Range Hostility**

Neferon’s default reaction to any intruder is to **attack on sight**. He resides within the **hollow head of the forty-foot-tall faceless statue** in the main temple (Area X5a), where he is shrouded in **magical darkness**.

- **Tactical Advantage:** From his elevated position, he uses eyeholes to monitor the temple floor and the southern balcony. He will likely open combat by sniping the party with long-ranged spells before they even identify his location.
- **Superior Senses:** Because he possesses **truesight**, Neferon can see the party even if they are invisible or attempting to hide in their own magical darkness.

### **2. Interaction with the Monk’s "Darkest Vision"**

The **Monk’s** recent "Deal with Darkness" granted him **black eyes and the ability to see through magical darkness**. This creates a unique dynamic:

- Neferon relies on the magical darkness inside the statue's head to remain unseen.
- The Monk is the only party member capable of seeing Neferon’s true form immediately, potentially stripping the arcanaloth of his primary defensive advantage. Neferon would likely perceive the Monk as a **high-priority target** once he realises his cover is blown.

### **3. The "Heinrich Stolt" Deception**

If the party survives the initial onslaught and manages to confront him, Neferon shifts from a magical sniper to a **manipulative liar**.

- **False Identity:** He often uses _alter self_ to appear as an old human wizard named **Heinrich Stolt**.
- **Feigned Confusion:** In this guise, he **feigns confusion** and claims he was merely guarding the temple, attempting to lower the party's guard or trick them into a parley.

### **4. Response to the Party’s "Vampiric" Allies**

The party is currently travelling with **Kasimir Velikov** and potentially **Lucian**, who was left in the care of **Ludmilla** and is now a vampire wizard.

- **Rahadin’s Influence:** The sources note that Neferon **knows Rahadin** and does not harm him when he visits the temple to pray.
- If Lucian or the party are accompanied by Rahadin or Ludmilla, Neferon may **stay his hand**, treating them as guests of the "Master" rather than intruders, at least initially.

### **5. Tactical Retreat and Ambush**

Neferon is not a mindless combatant; he is a coward who prioritises his own survival.

- If reduced to **less than half of his hit points**, he will **teleport to the temple floor, turn invisible, and flee**.
- He will not leave the temple, but he will hide and wait for a "safe" moment to launch a second surprise attack on the party.

**Analogy:** Neferon is like a **sniper in a clock tower who is also a trained stage actor.** He will happily shoot at you from the safety of the shadows until you break down his door; at that point, he will drop his rifle, put on a costume, and try to convince you that he is actually the tower's harmless old janitor.
