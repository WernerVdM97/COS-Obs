| **Title**  | Description     |
Vilnius is a human **mage** and the apprentice of the deceased wizard Jakarion; his reaction to the party will be characterized by **extreme suspicion, cowardice, and opportunistic greed**.

According to the sources, the party’s interaction with him would likely follow this progression:

### **1. Initial Fear and Hiding**

Vilnius is currently **hiding behind a lectern** in the Amber Temple’s lecture hall (Area X9). He is physically battered, with scorched robes, singed hair, and blisters from magic fire. His primary reaction is **fear**; he has been reduced to eating vermin and refuses to leave the room because an **amber golem** is patrolling the hallway outside. He will likely remain hidden unless the party destroys the golem or discovers him with a high enough passive Perception score.

### **2. Suspicious Engagement**

If the party finds him, Vilnius will be **outwardly suspicious and unfriendly**. He is accompanied by an **invisible quasit familiar**, which he may use to spy on the party during their conversation. He considers himself a survivor of a disastrous expedition and blames his "idiot" master for leading them into the temple.

### **3. Treacherous Cooperation**

Despite his hostility, Vilnius is a **treacherous coward** who will use the party to further his own ends.

- **Retrieval Mission:** He is desperate to recover his master’s **staff and spellbook** from the flameskulls in area X17. He may try to manipulate the party into clearing that area for him.
- **Information Trade:** He may share what he knows—specifically about the **flameskulls** and the **mountain folk** using the temple as a shelter—in exchange for protection or food.

### **4. Protective Greed (The Amulet)**

Vilnius possesses a **gold amulet** (worth 1,000 gp) hidden under his robes, which is the control mechanism for a **shield guardian** in the temple.

- Initially, he does not know what the amulet does, only that it is magical and valuable.
- If the party identifies the amulet's purpose, Vilnius will become **fiercely protective** of it and will refuse to part with it, seeing it as his ticket to power and safety within the temple.

**Analogy:** Vilnius is like a **starving rat caught in a corner.** He is too terrified of the "cat" outside (the amber golem) to move, but if you offer him a way out, he will grab at it with trembling hands—all while looking for the best moment to bite the fingers that fed him and steal whatever shiny trinkets you might be carrying.
