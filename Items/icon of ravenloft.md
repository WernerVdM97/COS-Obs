While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a [Protection from Evil and Good](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:protection-from-evil-and-good) spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.

**_Augury._** You can use an action to cast an [Augury](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:augury) spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Bane of the Undead._** You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.

**_Cure Wounds._** While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
