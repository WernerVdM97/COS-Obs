### **Pact of the Crimson Echo**

Upon attuning, the wielder begins to hear the heartbeat — not of the blade, but of themselves in echo. Every soul fed into the sword chips away their own.

- **Thirst Unending:** If you go more than 24 hours without killing a creature with the sword, take 2d10 psychic damage each dawn as the sword screams in your mind.
    
- **Mark of Blood:** Healing from any source other than the sword is halved.
    
- **Blood Madness (Optional):** On a critical hit, make a DC 13 Wisdom save or enter a blood frenzy (must attack the nearest creature on next turn).
    

To break the curse, the wielder must _willingly_ spill their own blood into the pool at the Shrine of Mother Night — and succeed a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw while holding the sword in the pool.
