## curses

- After consuming the Soulshard to gain an extra spell slot, the player must roll a d100.
- On a roll of 1–5 (representing a 5% chance), the player becomes haunted by the whispers of the captured soul.
- While haunted, the player experiences the following effects:
    - They gain disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and checks.
    - The whispers may manifest as vague, unsettling feelings, leading to occasional distractions in tense situations. This can result in disadvantage on one ability check or attack roll per session at the DM's discretion.
    - The whispers could also provide cryptic hints or warnings about impending danger, but it would be up to the DM to decide how useful or misleading these hints are.
