## lore

Legend speaks of the Feystone Ring being forged in the depths of a forgotten realm, crafted by a master enchanter who sought to harness the power of charisma for themselves. It is said that many who wore the ring became legendary orators and leaders, but all succumbed to madness as the whispers led them astray, turning allies into pawns and friends into enemies.

After 24 hours of continuous attunement, the vibrant colors of the stone begin to darken, mirroring the subtle corruption taking root in your mind. You gain disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws as the ring whispers sweet temptations and alluring promises, clouding your judgment and tainting your thoughts.
